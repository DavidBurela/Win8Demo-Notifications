Windows 8 demo - Toast notifications
=============

A sample application I use at user group and conference talks.
The source code is provided to allow anyone to participate, and to see how a very simplistic Windows Phone 7 application can be built in just a few hours.

IMPORTANT
-------

If you plan on using toast notifications in your application, ensure that you set **Toast Enabled** in the application manifest.

Samples
--------

Included in the source code are samples on how to:

* Create a toast notification which displays text only
* Create a toast notification which uses a local image
* How to use the XML templates and modify them for your own use
